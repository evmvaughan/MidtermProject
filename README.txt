How long did this assignment take you?
8+ hours

How much did the lab help you for this assignment? 1-10 (1 - did not help at all, 10 - this was exactly the same as the lab)

5 - There were a lot of extra pieces that took a while to understand including the arcball dyamics, boundaries, and 3D player movement. 

How fun was this assignment? 1-10 (1 - discontinue this assignment, 10 - I wish I had more time to make it even better)

6 - Overall, the assignment was a lot of fun but it is very difficult deriving many of the character and camera functions without office hours. I cannot make the office hours unfortunately.
