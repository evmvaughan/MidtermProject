Brief Description: 
The program creates a 3D world with 4 of our hero models. There are 
three different camera view models and light types implemented. 

Usage:
The program runs in C++, you should be able to compile it by importing 
the source code into CLion. 
- The key 'P' performs changing player(hero). 
- The key 'Z' changes camera model. 
- The key 'Space' zooms in for free camera model.
- The key 'X' zooms out for free camera model.
- The keys "W,A,S,D" correspond to front, left, back, right movement 
of the heros. 

There is no bug, there is only feature.

Distribution of responsibilities:
Evan - build his own model, arc ball camera model, and imported the 
       customshader.
Alex - Player movement, player switching, and lighting. 
Reed - Build my own model, finished all model animation while moving, 
       added the fireflies as additional animated objects,
       recorded the video, and wrote this README file.
Kane - Did the illumination and Phong reflection model.

Time consumption:
	Alex: 10,
 	Evan: unknown,
 	Reed: 7,
 	Kane: unknown
Total: 10 + 7 = 17+ (I'd say it is near 30 hrs)
